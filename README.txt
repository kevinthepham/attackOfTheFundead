<h1>JavaScript Game Requirements</h1>
  
<p><span>There are several elements that must be present in your game:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Your scene must be drawn using a HTML5 canvas.</strong><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Your game must accept input from the keyboard and/or the mouse.</strong><br>Be sure to explain on the webpage<span>&nbsp;</span>what the different keys and mouse do. A new player should be able to read the page and start playing the game right away. For instance, the mouse may be used to aim a missile launcher and clicking shoots a missile. It is typically standard for the<span>&nbsp;</span>w, a, s, d<span>&nbsp;</span>keys or arrow keys to be used if moving a character around the screen.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Your game must have an incentive/reward/goal/target.</strong><br>In most games this is Points, but it doesn't need to be, many racing games have a fastest lap record. Your game must have a goal that the player is striving for. Why is the user playing your game? What are they trying to accomplish? &nbsp;Your game needs to have some sort of score that can be used to keep a ranking of all games played. &nbsp;You will need to incorporate a High Score API in to your game that will keep the Top 10 highest scores.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Your game must have a conflict which attempts to hinder the user from achieving the incentive/reward/goal/target.</strong><br>There should be an antagonist present that is attempting to prevent the player from completing their given task. This does not need to be complex! There does not need to be a multilayer AI playing for the computer. Think of the asteroids in Asteroid, they have a direction they move along and if they hit the ship, you lose a life. Or in Tetris the blocks can only move down until they hit another block. More details about the conflict are given below.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>It must be possible to lose your game.</strong><br>Oddly enough, it is not always fun to play a game that is "broken" and is instantly beatable. If the conflict in your game occurs often enough, then the game should end. This does not necessarily need to be a health system (number of lives, Health Points, etc.). Perhaps a task needs to be completed in a certain amount of time. Whatever method is used, make sure this information is available to the user so they are aware if the end is near. When a player loses a game, they now have an additional incentive to play again and better their score or get further into the game.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is up to you to determine the format and structure of your game. The graphics involved do not need to be complex either, the focus is not on the design or modeling of each object in your scene. Instead the focus should be on the interaction between the player and the game as well as the gameplay. Once the above criteria are satisfied, then feel more than free to make your game look as cool as possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The game needs to be complex enough that there is enough work for all three team members to equally contribute. &nbsp;In the end, if it looks like very little effort was given - points will be deducted. &nbsp;Additionally,&nbsp;</span>don't go online and do a Google search for a game that's already written. I know how to use Google just as well as you (and since this is a competition, your classmates might also send an anonymous tip if they discover this type of plagiarism).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the website portion, you will need to use HTML5 and CSS3 features. &nbsp;Your game will need to be comprised of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>single</strong></span> webpage (which, spoiler alert, will be called index.html). &nbsp;It will be wise to focus the HTML5 &amp;&nbsp;CSS3 requirements towards making the webpage look good and the JavaScript requirements towards the actual game play.</p>
